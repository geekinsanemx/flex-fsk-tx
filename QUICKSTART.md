## üöÄ Step 1: Get Your Hardware Ready

### Unbox and Inspect Your Device
1. **Remove ESP32 board** from packaging
2. **Locate the antenna connector** (small gold connector)
3. **Attach the antenna** - gently connect antenna to the gold connector
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER power on without antenna** - this can damage the radio
4. **Find the USB port** (usually USB-C)

### Connect to Computer
1. **Plug USB cable** into your ESP32 device
2. **Connect other end** to your computer
3. **Look for power indicators** - LED should light up on the board
4. **Check if computer detects device**:
   - **Windows**: Check Device Manager ‚Üí Ports
   - **Mac/Linux**: Open terminal and run `ls /dev/tty*` - look for new device

- ‚úÖ Direct USB connection (no WiFi needed)
- ‚úÖ More technical but very powerful

**Choose your path below** ‚¨áÔ∏è

---

## üåê Path A: Web Interface (Beginner-Friendly)

*Requirements: TTGO LoRa32-OLED device*

### Step A1: Install Special Firmware

**This gives your device WiFi powers and a web interface**

1. **Install firmware and libraries**: Follow [FIRMWARE.md](FIRMWARE.md) for complete instructions
   - Choose **TTGO LoRa32-OLED v3 firmware**
   - This includes WiFi, web interface, and REST API
2. **Verify installation**: Device should show "flex-fsk-tx" on its small screen

### Step A2: First Power-On Setup

1. **Power on device** (plug into USB or battery)
2. **Wait 30 seconds** for full startup
3. **Check the small screen** - should display:
   ```
   flex-fsk-tx
   AP Mode: TTGO_FLEX_XXXX
   192.168.4.1
   ```

### Step A3: Connect to Device's WiFi

Your device creates its own WiFi network for setup:

1. **On your phone/computer**: Look for WiFi network named `TTGO_FLEX_XXXX`
   - The XXXX will be unique to your device
2. **Connect to this network**:
   - **Password**: `12345678`
3. **Open web browser** and go to: `http://192.168.4.1`
4. **You should see**: FLEX Paging Message Transmitter configuration page

### Step A4: Connect Device to Your WiFi

1. **Click "Configuration"** on the webpage
2. **Enter your WiFi details**:
   - **Network Name (SSID)**: Your home/office WiFi name
   - **Password**: Your WiFi password
3. **Click "Save Settings"**
4. **Device will restart** and connect to your WiFi
5. **Note the new IP address** shown on device screen (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

### Step A5: Send Your First Message!

1. **Open web browser** and go to the new IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100`)
2. **Fill in the message form**:
   - **Frequency**: `929.6625` (common US frequency)
   - **Power**: `10` (safe starting power)
   - **Capcode**: `1234567` (test pager number)
   - **Message**: `Hello World - My First FLEX Message!`
3. **Click "Send Message"**
4. **Watch the device screen** - should show "Transmitting..."
5. **Success!** üéâ You've sent your first FLEX message

### What Just Happened?
- Your device transmitted a FLEX paging signal
- Any pager set to capcode `1234567` would receive your message
- The signal went out at 929.6625 MHz frequency
- You used 10 dBm of transmission power

## üíª Path B: AT Commands (Advanced Users)

*Works with any ESP32 LoRa32 device*

### Step B1: Install Basic Firmware

1. **Install firmware**: Follow [FIRMWARE.md](FIRMWARE.md) for complete instructions
   - For **TTGO**: Choose v1 or v2 firmware
   - For **Heltec**: Choose v1 or v2 firmware
2. **Verify installation**: Device should show "flex-fsk-tx" on screen

### Step B2: Build Command-Line Tool

1. **Open terminal** in project directory
2. **Build the software**:
   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
3. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   flex-fsk-tx --help
   ```

### Step B3: Find Your Device

1. **Identify serial port**:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac:
   ls /dev/tty*
   # Look for /dev/ttyUSB0 (Heltec) or /dev/ttyACM0 (TTGO)
   
   # Windows: Check Device Manager ‚Üí Ports
   ```

### Step B4: Test Communication

1. **Test basic connection**:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac example:
   echo "AT" | screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
   # Should respond: OK
   ```

### Step B5: Send Your First Message!

**Simple method** (works with all firmware):
```bash
# Replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your device port
flex-fsk-tx -d /dev/ttyUSB0 1234567 "Hello World - My First FLEX Message!"
```

**Advanced method** (v2+ firmware with on-device encoding):
```bash
# Uses device's built-in FLEX encoder
flex-fsk-tx -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -r 1234567 "Hello World - My First FLEX Message!"
```

**Manual AT commands** (for learning):
```bash
# Connect to device
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

# Send commands:
AT+FREQ=929.6625    # Set frequency
AT+POWER=10         # Set power
AT+MSG=1234567      # Start message to capcode 1234567
Hello World!        # Type message and press Enter
# Device responds: OK (message sent!)
```

## üéØ Understanding What You Just Did

### FLEX Paging Basics
- **FLEX** = A digital paging protocol
- **Capcode** = Unique number identifying each pager (like a phone number)
- **Frequency** = Radio frequency for transmission (must match pager's frequency)
- **Power** = Transmission strength (higher = further range)

### Your Message Journey
1. **You typed** a message and capcode
2. **Device encoded** message in FLEX format
3. **Radio transmitted** signal at specified frequency
4. **Any pager** with matching capcode received the message

## üö® Common First-Time Issues

### "Device not found"
- **Check USB cable** - must support data (not just charging)
- **Try different port** - /dev/ttyUSB1, COM4, etc.
- **Install drivers** - Some devices need specific USB drivers

### "Firmware upload failed"
- **Hold BOOT button** while clicking Upload in Arduino IDE
- **Try slower speed** - Change upload speed to 115200
- **Check board selection** - Must match your hardware exactly

### "Web interface not working"
- **Check device screen** - should show IP address
- **Verify same network** - Computer and device on same WiFi
- **Try direct connection** - Connect to device's AP mode

### "No response to AT commands"
- **Check baud rate** - Must be 115200
- **Set line endings** - Use "Both NL & CR" in terminal
- **Press RESET** - Reset device and try again
